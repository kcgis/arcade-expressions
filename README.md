Arcade Expressions for the Recorded Document Workflow

The workflow makes extensive use of **Data Expressions**. These are written in *Arcade*, a JS-like language specific to Esri products. Writing expressions in the Dashboard can be problematic, as users are unable to save an expression unless it has a valid output.

To better document these expressions, as well as make it easier to develop longer, more complex expressions, this repo will store all of them.
